# Introduction

Functions work the same way as JavaScript functions.

A [function signature](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/135205/what-is-a-function-signature-and-function-selector-in-solidity-and-evm-language) also known as a type signature, or method signature) defines input and output of functions or methods.

```solidity
// function signature 
function add(uint x, uint y) external pure returns (uint)
```

ADD FUNCTION INFO
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity 0.8.13;

contract Functions {
    function add(uint x, uint y) external pure returns (uint) {
      return x + y;
    }
    
    function sub(uint x, uint y) external pure returns (uint) {
      return x - y;
    }
}
```

In Solidity, function modifiers are used to change the behavior of a function by adding additional functionality or checks before or after the function is executed. 

Some of the built-in modifiers in Solidity `0.8.17` include:

`public`: 
- makes the function visible to other contracts and external callers.
`private`: 
- makes the function only visible to the current contract and not to derived contracts.
`internal`: makes the function only visible to the current contract and its derived contracts.
`external`: makes the function only accessible to outside contract and its derived contracts.
`view`: makes the function a read-only function that does not modify the state of the contract.
`pure`: makes the function a read-only function that does not modify the state of the contract and does not depend on any external state.
`constant`: same as `view`.
`payable`: allows the function to receive ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain).
`nonpayable`: function that may not receive ether.

Some function modifers are necessary to describe the basic functionality of the function like the following: 
- `external` / `internal`
- `public` / `private` 
- `view` | `pure`

Additionally, custom modifiers can also be defined and used in a contract. We will cover those in the next section.

ADD THIS TO STUFF UP TOP
`view`:
- A read-only function. 
- Doesn't modify the contract state data. Since no data is changed, calling these functions are free.
- No state updates to the blockchain.
- reads or uses data from contract.

`pure`:
- Just like `view`, but doesn't read any state variables data from contract.

`external`:
- Can only be called by outside callers, not from  functions inside the contract.

`internal`
- can only be called by internally functions inside the same contract.
